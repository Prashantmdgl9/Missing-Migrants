# Missing-Migrants
Repo for missing migrants data analysis and exploration

A few weeks ago, I stumbled upon the Missing Migrants Project and the associated data and it refreshed my memory of the train incident. So, I spent some time wrangling the data to find a few eye opening facts.
This work isn't a display of data science capabilities, it is merely an attempt to look at one of the ongoing tragic event of our lives. I've decided in favor of monochromatic visualisations given the subject matter. 

This is my humble attempt to throw some light on the fatal and perilous journeys a few have to take to save their lives.


The missing migrants project is trying to capture as much info as possible about the migrants and it comes from myriad sources - a few of them are legit and rest of them might be underreporting for various purposes. There is a lot of missing data esp. for :

* Number of survivors, 85% missing - People could have gone missing after disembarkment or political reasons such as to placate the citizens that not too many migrants are entering the country. 
* Number of children who survived, 86% missing - Minor trafficking 
* Migrant routes, 55% missing - Due to policies survivors might refrain from telling the exact route they took or they might not even know where they were.
